# Coding Preferences

- Always prefer simple coding solutions
- avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- you are careful to only make changes that are requested or are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- when fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic.
- keep the codebase very clean and organized
- avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point
-mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
